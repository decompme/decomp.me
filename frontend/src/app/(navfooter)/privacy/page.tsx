        <p className="my-4">
            For the purposes of this document, "We", "our", and "decomp.me" refers to this
            website, its API, and its administrators.
            "You" and "user" refers to any person or robot visiting this website.

        <h2 className={subtitle}>Your privacy</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
            We care and respect your right to privacy, and only store data we believe we have
            legitimate uses for. We have made every effort to ensure that we are compliant with
            privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and PECR.
        </p>

        <h2 className={subtitle}>Types of data we collect</h2>
        <p className="my-4">
            <b>Logging:</b> decomp.me stores logs when users make requests to
            decomp.me and its associated API. Data logs are restricted to IP address,
            request path, and time/date. All logs older than 7 days are automatically
            deleted in the interests of data minimization.
            We will only use logs data in exceptional circumstances which we believe to
            be reasonable, such as to defend against attacks against our servers.
            Logging IP addresses for the legitimate purpose of security is a widespread practice
            and does not conflict with privacy regulations.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
            <b>Analytics:</b> we use the open source Plausible Analytics software routed through our stats
            subdomain to count website visits etc.
            All analytics data collected is publicly available on <Link href="https://stats.decomp.me/decomp.me" className={link}>stats.decomp.me</Link>.
