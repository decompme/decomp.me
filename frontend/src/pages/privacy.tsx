                    For the purposes of this document, "We", "our", and "decomp.me" refers to this
                    website, its API, and its administrators.
                    "You" and "user" refers to any person or robot visiting this website.

                <h2>Your privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    We care and respect your right to privacy, and only store data we believe we have
                    legitimate uses for. We have made every effort to ensure that we are compliant with
                    privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and PECR.
                </p>

                <h2>Types of data we collect</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Logging:</b> decomp.me stores logs when users make requests to
                    decomp.me and its associated API. Data logs are restricted to IP address,
                    request path, and time/date. All logs older than 7 days are automatically
                    deleted in the interests of data minimization.
                    We will only use logs data in exceptional circumstances which we believe to
                    be reasonable, such as to defend against attacks against our servers.
                    Logging IP addresses for the legitimate purpose of security is a widespread practice
                    and does not conflict with privacy regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Analytics:</b> we use the open source Plausible Analytics software routed through our stats
                    subdomain to count website visits etc.
                    All analytics data collected is publicly available on <Link href="https://stats.decomp.me/decomp.me">stats.decomp.me</Link>.
                    All site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously and in aggregate only.
                    Analytics data collected is limited to:

                    <li>Country, region, city (using IP address, which is then discarded)</li>
                    <li>Actions taken on the site, such as compiling or saving a scratch</li>

                    voluntarily submitted to us. For logged-in users, this includes basic GitHub profile
                    information such as name, email, and avatar. For all users, data submitted on the
                    new scratch page and saved in the scratch editor will be stored and linked to your

                <p>

                    voluntarily-submitted information to your session on our site. If you are logged in,
                    this cookie will link your session to your account on decomp.me. We do not show any
                    'cookie banners' or 'privacy popups' on decomp.me because we do not use any third-party

                <h2>How data is stored and used</h2>
                <p>
                    decomp.me does not sell, rent, or mine user information under any circumstances.
                    decomp.me's servers are located in Finland. which means that we will
                    transfer, process, and store your information there. In very extreme cases, such as if
                    required by police or other government agencies, data may be disclosed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Analytics data is used to prioritise what site features and fixes should be worked
                    on and to let us determine features which are popular or unpopular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voluntarily-submitted information is used to provide vital site features such
                    as user profile pages and the scratch editor. We also reserve the right to use
                    any and all voluntarily-submited information for improving existing decompilation
                    tools and developing new ones. This will not involve sharing information with third parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We make every effort to keep your data secure. In the case of a breach, we will
                    notify you and take appropriate action, such as revoking GitHub OAuth tokens.
                    Please note that our servers never receive or store user passwords.
